All the details on this site were given by the hostelers themselves. For the initial setup we had to survey a major number of students to get these details. Now, that we have basic details documented, we need you to keep us updated for any kind of information that can be useful for the future hostelers.

If you have 5 minutes then please fill [this form](http://tinyurl.com/helpusform) regarding the PGs you have stayed in or going to stay in.
If you have any other information that you'd want to intimate us about, then you can mail anyone from the list of team members on the [Contact Us]({{ site.url }}/JCatalog/contact/) page.
